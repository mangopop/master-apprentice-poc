# Rules and instructions
There are 20 levels, each level you battle with a monster. Once you die - the game is over.
Life carries over each round and can only be replenished with cards.
There are 5 kinds of stat
- stamina (energy to hit - lower it is the less accurate)
- agility (how fast you can hit)
- attack (the damage you can inflict)
- strength (the lower end of the random attack modifier - increase criticals. Only equip certain items with strength.)
- defence (reduction from damage)

# Monsters and Bosses
Each 5 levels there is a boss monster, these are always the same. You must build strategies to defeat a certain boss with your cards.

# Stamina
Stamina is depleted with each attack whether it hits or misses - it is revived slightly per round.
If the stamina falls to under 20 - agility deteriates and stamina is given slight increase

# Training
After each level you can train your character.
You can increase base stats using remaining stamina from previous round - spending too much on training leaves you weak for the next fight, but these increases are permanent

# Locations
You will battle in a different location each time. It could be somewhere that advantages the monster, you, both or neither. Depending on abilities you have.

# Cards
there 7 types of cards
- weapons
- armour
- potions
- items
- abilities
- spells
- rings

You get to pick 1 card each level from a random selection of 3. You can get a random 5 to play from each round - you can play a maximum of 3 per round.

Each attack/defend card applies some bonus to stats that only last for that round. Or some immediate damage to the monster regardless of your stats.

# Elemental cards
Some cards are elementals of 4 types
- fire
- ice
- earth
- wind

monsters are immune or weak to some of these - they also may get a bonus in certain locations

These cards generally do large or sustain damage outside or you attack cycle.

Some weapons have elemental abilities

# Synergies
There are 3 different folklores for cards
- human
- dwarf
- elf

They might be weapons, armour or items

If you play all 3 of the same folklore you will get a big bonus for that round.

# Location bonuses
Some locations are the home of the human, dwarf or elves. If You play any card that and the folklore matches the location - that card get's a 20% boost.
Other locations might give the monster some immunity or ability!

# Talismans
Every 5 levels you get to pick a Talisman which is passive for all further rounds
